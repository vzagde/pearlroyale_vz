			<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the personal information that you provide to us on Web sites controlled by Abbott (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) which link to this Privacy Policy (referred to as "Abbott Web sites").

	    <div class="content-block inset">
	      <div class="content-block-inner">
	        <p>"Personal Information" means information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you and which is submitted to and/or collected by Abbott Web sites and maintained by Abbott in an accessible form. Examples of personal information include your name, your postal address and your telephone number.</p>

	    <div class="content-block inset">
	      <div class="content-block-inner">
	        <p>Abbott collects information in two ways:</p>
	        <!-- <ul> -->
			<p>Personal Information you submit: Abbott collects personal information that you enter into data fields on Abbott Web sites. For example, you may submit your name, postal address, e-mail address, and/or other information in order to receive information about various subjects, register for Abbott programs, contact Abbott customer service, or respond to Abbott surveys. To protect your privacy, you should not provide Abbott with any information that is not specifically requested or that you do not wish to share.</p>
			<p>Passive Collection of Unidentifiable Information: Abbott Web sites may collect information about your visits to Abbott Web sites without you actively submitting such information. Unidentifiable information may be collected using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags, and web beacons. Your Internet browser automatically transmits to Abbott Web sites some of this unidentifiable information, such as the URL of the Web site you just visited and the browser version your computer is operating. Passive information collection technologies can make your use of Abbott Web sites easier by allowing Abbott to provide better service, customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, analyze trends, and otherwise administer and improve Abbott Web sites. Certain features of Abbott Web sites may not work without use of passive information collection technologies. Information collected by these technologies cannot be used to identity you without additional identifiable information.</p>

After you have entered personal information into a form or data field on an Abbott Web site, Abbott may use certain identifying technologies to allow that Web site to "remember" your personal preferences, such as sections of that Web site that you visit frequently and, if you choose, your user ID. We may also use this personal information for other business purposes, such as to offer you the opportunity to receive notices regarding Abbott’s products or services or to invite you to participate in surveys about our products.</p>
